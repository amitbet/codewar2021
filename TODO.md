# pacMan of War Tasklist:

## Basic Bot driving:
1. Add win/lose logic to game over
2. Add winner picutre display to game over logic
3. Play the game and lookout for bugs introduced by bot logic insertion
4. look at ghost release delay when in ghost-home (it looks like it doesn't work)
5. think if ghost scatter mode should be controlled by the bot
6. TODO: Check if a ghostbot move is an allowed move in the game (no collision detection there...)
